     <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
       <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month!
         I went with a friend and we were able to see many
         things while we were there!</p>
       <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
         <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <strong>Montmartre</strong> right away.
           Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!)
           We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <strong>la Seine</strong>.</p>

       <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
         <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <strong>Avenue des Champs Elysees</strong>.
            Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.
            After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!
            We went to <strong>Notre Dame</strong>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all
            of the best macarons the city had to offer.
            After we finished shopping, we visited <strong>le Louvre</strong>.</p>

       <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
         <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <strong>Arc de Triomphe</strong>.
            It's huge! We also went to <strong>le Musee D'Orsay</strong>. Seeing the
            work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely
            breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also
            had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin,
            Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
